Summary :

This C code is an implementation of a Sudoku puzzle game. 
It includes functions for generating a Sudoku grid, printing the grid, 
checking if a move is valid, solving the puzzle using backtracking, and 
allowing the user to interact with the puzzle by inputting values.

The code utilizes a 9x9 grid with specific placeholders for empty cells 
and a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle. It incorporates a 
simple method to generate a solvable Sudoku puzzle. 
The program also allows users to interactively input values into the grid 
and checks whether the input is valid based on Sudoku rules.

In summary, the code presents a comprehensive implementation of a Sudoku game in C,
offering a basic understanding of how to create, solve, and interact with a Sudoku 
puzzle through programming.

How to run , what to input & what to expect to see as a result -

Run - You have to run the code in c compiler or in Linux 
First it will ask you to set difficulty level.
After running it will generate the sudoku puzzle according to different levels.
Now it will ask you to input numbers from 1 to 9. 
You have to give three numbers as input i.e. first for the row, the second for the column, 
and the third for the number. 
The third number will fill the place in the row number and column number .
If all three numbers are correct then it will fill that place and will give
you the updated sudoku puzzle.
